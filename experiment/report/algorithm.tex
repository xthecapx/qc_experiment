\section*{Benchmarking design}

This study seeks to develop a variant of the teleportation protocol to be executed within a single QPU. The objective is to establish a benchmarking strategy that can subsequently be generalized to multiple QPUs by transitioning from the protocol variant to the complete teleportation protocol.

The primary objective of the experiment is to identify pre-runtime metrics that demonstrate a correlation with the success rate (post-runtime metric). To this end, the initial iteration of the experiment is designed to evaluate the success rate of transmitting a quantum state across the circuit from left to right. This is accomplished by employing RB within the payload to produce messages, thereby repeatedly applying quantum gates to intentionally amplify and characterize errors. The success rate is calculated by performing the conjugate operation before measurement, with the objective of achieving a value of 0 as a result of the measured qubit.

The experimentation phase was structured into three distinct tests. The initial experiment was a stress test that involved generating N random gates to serve as the message to be propagated. Subsequently, the aim was to develop strategies to maintain a specified circuit depth, and ultimately to evaluate how error rates scale when the number of qubits increases. Details about each experiment are presented in Section \nameref{sec:experiment}.

\section*{Algorithm design}
\label{sec:algorithm}

Running the protocol on a single qubit involves additional complexity to ensure that the chip utilizes physically separated qubits. Typically, targeting two distant qubits on the same chip is achievable by performing multiple swap operations before protocol preparation, although this configuration might introduce additional errors.

Therefore, we modified the protocol so that, instead of transporting quantum information between two distant qubits, we could test the quantum state while being subject only to errors from the required gates of the algorithm and those introduced by the hybrid benchmark in the payload (M in the equations).

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for testing quantum states in a quantum circuit. Inspired by TP, our algorithm propagates the state through the circuit instead of transmitting quantum information between distant qubits. This method enables us to analyze random operations using a hybrid benchmark framework.

\subsection*{Variation of the Teleportation Protocol (vTP)}

As with TP, vTP can be described in three main phases: first, the preparation of the quantum state (the message qubit M) to be processed; second, the application of the core protocol gates (Bell State setup); and third, the state reconstruction or transformation. vTP notably differs from standard TP in the last phase: it employs CNOT and CZ gates instead of measurement operations and does not require a classical communication channel for state reconstruction.

The vTP circuit diagram is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:vtp_circuit}.

\begin{figure}[ht]

The final parts illustrate the validation sequence and measurement operations used to determine execution success.}
    \label{fig:vtp_circuit}
\end{figure}

To initiate the theoretical examination of vTP, start by using the Bell state given in Equation~\ref{eq:teleportation_grouped_state} for qubits M and A in terms of the computational basis.

The standard TP involves Alice executing the measure operation on her qubits M and A, followed by sending the results to Bob via the classical communication channel in order to reconstruct her quantum state.

However, at this point, vTP and TP diverge. Instead of conditional operations and measurements, vTP unconditionally applies two gates: first, a \textbf{CX} gate between qubits A and B (\(CX_{AB}\), with A as control and B as target), followed by a \textbf{CZ} gate between qubits M and B (\(CZ_{MB}\), with M as control and B as target).

To observe the effect of this new gate sequence on the state \(\ket{\Psi_{MAB}}\) of Equation~\ref{eq:teleportation_grouped_state}, we apply these operations sequentially.

\subsubsection*{Effect of $CX_{AB}$}

Because quantum gates act linearly on superpositions, we can evaluate the action of \(CX_{AB}\) on the state in Equation~\ref{eq:teleportation_grouped_state} term by term. Recall that \(CX_{AB}\) flips the target qubit B if the control qubit A is in state \(\ket{1}\). Applying it to each computational basis component yields the following.

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
CX_{AB}\ket{00}_{MA}(\alpha\ket{0} + \beta\ket{1})_B &= \ket{00}_{MA}(\alpha\ket{0} + \beta\ket{1})_B,\\
CX_{AB}\ket{01}_{MA}(\alpha\ket{1} + \beta\ket{0})_B &= \ket{01}_{MA}(\alpha\ket{0} + \beta\ket{1})_B,\\
CX_{AB}\ket{10}_{MA}(\alpha\ket{0} - \beta\ket{1})_B &= \ket{10}_{MA}(\alpha\ket{0} - \beta\ket{1})_B,\\
CX_{AB}\ket{11}_{MA}(\alpha\ket{1} - \beta\ket{0})_B &= \ket{11}_{MA}(\alpha\ket{0} - \beta\ket{1})_B.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Combining these, the state after \(CX_{AB}\), denoted \(\ket{\Psi'_{MAB}}\), becomes:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\ket{\Psi'_{MAB}} = \frac{1}{2} [ & \ket{00}_{MA}(\alpha\ket{0} + \beta\ket{1})_B + \ket{01}_{MA}(\alpha\ket{0} + \beta\ket{1})_B \\
& + \ket{10}_{MA}(\alpha\ket{0} - \beta\ket{1})_B + \ket{11}_{MA}(\alpha\ket{0} - \beta\ket{1})_B ]
\end{split}
\label{eq:state_after_cx_ab}
\end{equation}

This state can be factorized as follows.

\begin{equation}
\ket{\Psi'_{MAB}} = \ket{+}_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} [ \ket{0}_M (\alpha\ket{0} + \beta\ket{1})_B + \ket{1}_M (\alpha\ket{0} - \beta\ket{1})_B ]
\label{eq:factorized_after_cx_ab}
\end{equation}
where \(\ket{+}_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\ket{0}_A + \ket{1}_A)\).

\subsubsection*{Effect of \(CZ_{MB}\)}

Next, we apply \(CZ_{MB}\) to the state \(\ket{\Psi'_{MAB}}\) from Equation~\ref{eq:factorized_after_cx_ab}. In this case, the \(\ket{+}_A\) factor is unaffected. 

We focus on the MB part:
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
CZ_{MB} & \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} [ \ket{0}_M (\alpha\ket{0} + \beta\ket{1})_B + \ket{1}_M (\alpha\ket{0} - \beta\ket{1})_B ] \right) \\
&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} [ \ket{0}_M (\alpha\ket{0} + \beta\ket{1})_B + \ket{1}_M Z_B(\alpha\ket{0} - \beta\ket{1})_B ] \\
&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} [ \ket{0}_M (\alpha\ket{0} + \beta\ket{1})_B + \ket{1}_M (\alpha\ket{0} + \beta\ket{1})_B ] \\
&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\ket{0}_M + \ket{1}_M) \otimes (\alpha\ket{0} + \beta\ket{1})_B \\
&= \ket{+}_M \otimes (\alpha\ket{0} + \beta\ket{1})_B
\end{split}
\label{eq:mb_part_after_cz_mb}
\end{align}

Therefore, the total final state after applying \(CZ_{MB} CX_{AB}\) is:
\begin{equation}
\ket{\Psi''_{MAB}} = \ket{+}_A \otimes \ket{+}_M \otimes (\alpha\ket{0} + \beta\ket{1})_B
\label{eq:final_state_variation}
\end{equation}

From Equation~\ref{eq:final_state_variation}, we observe that the quantum state of Bob's qubit (B) is \((\alpha\ket{0} + \beta\ket{1})_B\), which is identical to the original state of Alice's message qubit M (as described in Equation~\ref{eq:teleportation_initial_state}). Furthermore, qubits M and A are now in the \(\ket{+}_M\) and \(\ket{+}_A\) states, respectively, and all three qubits (M, A, B) are disentangled. This confirms that vTP successfully transfers the initial state of M to B without relying on measurement operations, a classical communication channel, or conditional gate logic, making it suitable for hybrid benchmarks, including those on a single QPU.
